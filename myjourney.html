			<h1> Road to success </h1>
			<h3> My journey </h3>
			<p> I came across a lot of obstacles in my life trying to get back in school. </p>
			<p> I graduated high school back in 2012, I went to Simeon Career Academy on the southside of Chicago. After, that I went to a community college in Champaign Urbana called parkland college. </p>
			<p> Moving along, I came back home (Chicago, IL) I was undecided, and from that point on I felt like college was a gimmick. I felt like college was a gimmick because I know a plethora of people who went to college, and don’t have a job. </p>
			<p> Fast forward to 2016 I actually had a mental breakthrough. I had a breakthrough meaning, I wanted better for myself. I had to get on a 9-month payment plan in order to take out another loan. </p>
			<p> Once, I started making payments, I was doing really good. I was doing really good until the 8-month payment, I missed it and the company had me start over from month one.But, once I started over and I completed the payment, I was now back in school and can take out loans again. </p>
			<p> Furthermore, I made a promise to myself that I will not stop until I get my master's degree. My biggest motivation is my mom because she graduated from college, and I started college and stopped. She has been telling me for years to get back in school. I was so anti-school, and always stated: "it's just a piece of paper it doesn't mean anything." So, I had a mental breakthrough and had to self reflect on my future, and lord behold I'm back in school again. My major is Cyber Security and Digital Forensics. I chose the major because i wanted to save people from identity theft and fraud. Also, I like computers a lot, but I was always into hacking, and I had dreams of working with the government. I have two friends that work for the government and there waiting for me to graduate, so I can be great like them. After a few years in the field, I will be opening up my own Cyber Security firm.  </p>
